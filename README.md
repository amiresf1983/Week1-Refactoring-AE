# Week1-Refactoring-AE

# The Story

I have been given a project by the client to work on it and make it more accessible for disable people who use assistive technology and also more suitable for search engines.
the project is basically a refactoring process.
I need to put the codes in a logical way based on semantic HTML and follow all the web development standards. the key thing is that all the changes will be applied to HTML and CSS files but the website must be unchanged so there will be no change in the style and I only need to play with HTML and CSS codes to organise the project and make it more accesible.

# Acceptance Criteria

the project will be approved only if it meets these criteria below:

- meeting the accesibility standards
- following semantic HTML elements
- the structure and higheracy is standard
- styling and positioning of elements are in a logical way
- the title is relevant
- the images have alt attribute
